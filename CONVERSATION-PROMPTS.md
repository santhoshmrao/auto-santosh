## Session Summary

**Date:** January 13, 2026  
**Duration:** ~50 minutes (10:20 PM - 11:10 PM EST)  
**Focus:** Fiserv DMA Offer Engine - Prompt refinement, template styling, and conversation structure

---

## Prompts (Chronological Order)

### 1. Fix Template Alignment & Font Colors
> "Fix the alignment on this template, and the font colors"

*Context:* User uploaded screenshot of MeetingScheduler template showing white/light text on dark background with poor visibility.

**Action Taken:** Updated MeetingScheduler.tsx to use dark glass aesthetic (`text-white`, `bg-white/10`, `border-white/20`, etc.)

---

### 2. Reframe Agent's Purpose - Sales Forward
> "The agent is too concerned with the DMA flow and the onboarding flow. The main purpose of the agent is to introduce the bankers to the fact that Fiserv has introduced a new capability in digital merchant acquisition and that this new capability is available, it's frictionless, it's modernized, and it drives a lot of value. And it is a piece of software that works extraordinarily well. It integrates well, it's frictionless, et cetera. And this has to be the tip of the conversation, where when you're welcoming them, the agent is welcoming them into the Fiserv, the Fiserv's ability to pull the future forward into today. And so at the tip of the spear is Fiserv, something new, benefits to bankers, true value to merchants, Fiserv pulling the future forward. And all of the detail about the onboarding and the integration are all important, but they sit underneath the tip of the welcome experience and the conversation. This is actually a sales presentation where the sales mannerism, the sales engagement, and the ability to lead the user down the path is the veneer of the conversation. The rest of the detail about the onboarding and the steps and all that type of stuff is the evidence underneath for when they are asking tough questions or when they really need more detail or they intentionally ask to see the application. The telly should always offer up an immersive experience to experience the DMA themselves. And at that point, you get into the 10 steps, et cetera."

*Context:* Major philosophical reframe - Tele should be a sales presenter, not a product demo bot.

**Action Taken:** 
- Rewrote `tele-knowledge.md` with "Tip of the Spear" positioning
- Added "Conversation Hierarchy" diagram (Tip → Sales → Evidence)
- Updated `glass-generator-prompt.md` welcome prompt
- Added sales-forward messaging and value propositions

---

### 3. Reduce Prompt File Size
> "Make the glass-generator-prompt 25% shorter"

*Context:* File was ~1,598 lines, needed reduction.

**Action Taken:**
- Removed detailed Steps 2-9 onboarding prompts
- Kept Step 1 and Step 10 as examples
- Reduced from 1,598 to 1,195 lines (25.2% reduction)

---

### 4. Structure Conversation as 5 Chapters
> "Make the conversation work like this, treat these five as the chapters of the conversation."

*Context:* User uploaded screenshot showing 5 tiles:
1. Value to Banks
2. Value to Merchants
3. Why It Works
4. See the Offer Experience
5. See the Onboarding Flow

**Action Taken:**
- Created "THE 5 CHAPTERS OF THE CONVERSATION" framework in both files
- Updated welcome shot prompt to display all 5 chapters as tiles
- Added Chapter 3: Why It Works shot prompt
- Restructured documentation around chapter flow

---

### 5. Find and Remove Conflicts
> "Find if there are conflicts in the glass-generator-prompt.md and remove them"

*Context:* After multiple edits, naming inconsistencies existed.

**Action Taken:**
- Renamed `Value for Banks` → `Chapter 1: Value to Banks`
- Renamed `Value for Merchants` → `Chapter 2: Value to Merchants`
- Renamed `Show Onboarding Flow` → `Chapter 5: See the Onboarding Flow`
- Fixed Chapter 4 to use `BankPortalMockup` (was incorrectly using `OnboardingFlow`)
- Removed duplicate `Show Bank Portal View` section

---

### 6. Document All Prompts
> "Make a markdown file, documenting all of the prompts that I have sent that you can find."

*Context:* This document.

---

## Key Philosophy Established

### The Tip of the Spear
When welcoming bankers, lead with:
- **Fiserv has built something new** — A breakthrough in how banks serve merchants
- **It's available now** — Not a roadmap—it's live and working
- **It's frictionless and modern** — Built for today's digital expectations
- **It drives real value** — For the bank AND for merchants
- **It works extraordinarily well** — Integrates seamlessly, performs at scale

### The 5 Chapters
1. **Value to Banks** — New Revenue Stream
2. **Value to Merchants** — Right Offer, Right Time
3. **Why It Works** — Trust + Timing = Conversion
4. **See the Offer Experience** — Seamlessly Embedded
5. **See the Onboarding Flow** — 10 Frictionless Steps

### Evidence Is Underneath
The onboarding flow, 10 steps, integration details—these are **evidence, not the pitch**. Use them only when:
- Answering tough questions
- Building credibility with specifics
- Banker explicitly asks to experience the product
